title: Hello World!

Thank you for checking out my development blog! I am planning on using this space to document my process of creating a full stack application to serve as a portfolio project. 

The goals of the project are simple:

- make something that is useful, not just a coding challenge/bootcamp project
  
   Easy enough, right? My plan right now is to launch a custom website for a beekeeping collective I am a member of. I have identified a few pain points in our organization around scheduling and archiving team meetings, hive inspections, and various community outreach events, so the plan is to create a platform where all of this can be managed under one roof. I will start with a simple calendar to schedule meetings and inspections, and I can build out more features as I go.

   To get things going I will be starting off solo, but my dreams for this project include collaborating with others and making something that we can all be proud of and have as a portfolio project.

- use a brand new (to me) tech stack

   One of my selling points is that I am a swiss-army knife and can pick up new technologies quickly. What better way to showcase this than to make something where the _whole_ stack is unfamiliar to me? Maybe this should feel more daunting to me than it does, but I was so excited about getting this project moving that I barely slept last night due to my mind buzzing (this will not be my last bee pun) with ideas, so I think I am on the right path!

I want this application to be clean and follow best practices, while learning and improving myself along the whole stack. I will make several posts in the upcoming days as I plan which technologies I will use in my stack, then I will slow down and make updates as I have things to report, or weekly if I am running into problems.
