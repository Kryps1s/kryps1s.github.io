Hi, I'm Elliot! I was born and raised in Buffalo, New York but since 2018 I have been living in the incredible city of Montreal, Canada. I moved here because I was teaching myself French for fun and wanted to be able to use it, and after a few visits I fell in love. I have _a lot_ of hobbies; I am always trying to push myself to do and learn new things!

### Non Coding Hobbies/Personal Achievements
